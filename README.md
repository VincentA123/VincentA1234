<head>About Me</head>
<h1> Hi, I'm Vincent. I'm currently attending as a rising junior at Balboa High School.
Some of my hobbies are drawing, playing video games, organizing, watching  movies and listening music. A fun fact about myself is that I was born as an only child with a lot of cousins. I'm in E1T1 because I'm interested in learning and to further my knowledge of developing a successful website with guidance from E1T1 as well as applying the knowledge and skills for future purposes in jobs and careers.
